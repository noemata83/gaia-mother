                Few things are more important than our planet. The name Gaia (pronounced GUY-YA) comes from the gnostic term for Mother Earth, symbolic of our unyielding approach to developing safe and effective products for people, pets, and property.

        <h2>A proven track record in sustainability</h2>
        <p>
            Our belief in the importance of sustainable products is why we create. SafePaw was developed in 1987 out of necessity. Nothing in the market met our standards for safety, so we created the product we could trust. Our work continues with new products that uphold our commitment to sustainability.
