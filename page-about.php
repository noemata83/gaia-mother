        <h2>A proven track record in sustainability</h2>
        <p>
            Our belief in the importance of sustainable products is why we create. SafePaw was developed in 1987 out of necessity. Nothing in the market met our standards for safety, so we created the product we could trust. Our work continues with new products that uphold our commitment to sustainability.

            <h2>How We Started</h2>
            <p>Gaia USA has always been committed to creating sustainable products. In 1986, our founder received multiple patents for Safe Thaw, the foundation for our #1 selling product, Safe Paw.</p>
            <p>First sold to power generation companies, construction firms, railroads, and municipal governments, our products helped them comply with EPA standards when no other product could.</p>
            <p>From the beginning in 1986 to today, our company's commitment to innovative work remains. We will continue to create products that are 100% safe and put pets, people, and property first.</p>
